## Observation

1. **Endpoint Verification:**
   - The endpoint `https://fake-store-api.mock.beeceptor.com/api/orders/status?order_id={order_id}` is currently not returning the updated status for the "picked" state.
   - This API is used to check the order status rather than updating it.

2. **Functionality and Endpoint Availability:**
   - The functionality for updating the order status is expected but the corresponding endpoint for this operation is not available.

## Steps to Address the Issue

1. **Confirm the Correct Endpoint:**
   - Verify if there is an alternative or correct API endpoint for updating the order status. It’s crucial to ensure you have the correct endpoint for the desired functionality.

2. **Mock API Update:**
   - If the actual update endpoint is unavailable and you need it for development or testing, consider creating a mock API using tools such as Beeceptor, Mockoon, or Postman Mock Server. This will simulate the update functionality for your purposes.

3. **Update the Functionality:**
   - Modify your `updateOrderStatus` function or other relevant code to align with the correct API specifications once the endpoint is confirmed or updated. Ensure it handles the correct endpoint if it becomes available.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling in your code to manage scenarios where the expected functionality is not available. Provide clear user feedback indicating that the status update cannot be performed if necessary.

## Code for Update Functionality

### Using Axios for Update Request

Here’s an updated version of your `updateOrderStatus` function assuming the correct endpoint and request type:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export const updateOrderStatus = async (orderId) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://fake-store-api.mock.beeceptor.com/api/orders/status`,
      {
        params: {
          order_id: orderId,
          status: "picked",
        },
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }
    );
    console.log(response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error updating status:", error);
    throw error; // Rethrow the error to handle it in the calling function
  }
};
